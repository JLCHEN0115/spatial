## Cool Stuffs of Spatial Analysis in R

*In this section, I did some exploratory spatial data analysis in R. Due to the inherent complexity of spatial data, it could be nasty to deal with. However, the `sf` package provides a slik workflow in terms of spatial data, and coherent integration with `tidyverse` ecosystem. In the end of this section, I explored the rent in Wisconsin using US census API.*

```r
# Download (if needed) and load package management tools 
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") 
```

```r
# Download (if needed) and load some packages for spatial analysis
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, data.table, hrbrthemes, lwgeom, rnaturalearth, maps, mapdata, spData, tigris, tidycensus, leaflet, tmap, tmaptools) 
```

The `sf` is an important package in this illustration.[^1]  `tidycensus` and `tigris` are packages for the ease of using US census data. `tidyverse` contains the workhorse packages for (almost every) data analysis task in R. The `maps` and `mapdata` packages have detailed county- and state/province-level data for several individual nations.

Now, we read the Shapefile of Wisconsin using `sf::st_read`.
```r
## Read Shapefile[^2] in R using sf::st_readrm
wi_shape <- st_read("~/Documents/test-play/Just-Playing/WI_CensusTL_Counties_2019/WI_CensusTL_Counties_2019.shp", quiet = TRUE)
```
Using the Shapefile, we can draw a simple plot using `ggplot2` (one of my favourite package in R).

```r
## Counties of Wisconsin Plot
wi_shape_plot <- ggplot(data = wi_shape) +
  geom_sf(color = "ghostwhite", fill = "red3") + # add geom_sf layer
  labs(
    title = "Counties of Wisconsin", 
    caption = "Data: UW-Madison Robinson Map Library"
  )

wi_shape_plot
```

Here it is.
![](/Figures/wi_shape_plot.png)

# Wrangle the data to plot area information (in 1000 Square Kilometer)
wi_area <- wi_shape %>%
    mutate(AREA = ALAND/1000000000) # Create a new variable

# Plot the area of Counties in Wisconsin
wi_area_plot <- ggplot(wi_area) +
     geom_sf(aes(fill = AREA), alpha=0.8, col="white") +
     scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Area") + # For beauty and color-blind people.
     labs(  
       title = "Counties of Wisconsin", 
       caption = "Data: UW-Madison Robinson Map Library"
     )

[^1]: The “sf” stands for simple features, which is a simple (ahem!) standard for representing the spatial geometries of real-world objects on a computer.
[^2]: A *shapefile* is a simple, nontopological format for storing the geometric location and attribute information of geographic features.
